Looks

-use bootstrap framework tool to set up

-header (collapsable? small? ...not jumbotron)

-playing field: 5-2-5 in bootstrap
--picture thumbnail, name of character, whether they are the player (maybe tint the boxes green and red) and HP bar
--center has all attack options (just attack in basic version)

-character field
--split up by type/race
--descriptions for everything
-pic of character, name, description (maybe on hover of pic if no room), strengths and weaknesses, include icons for strengths/weaknesses, hover gives description of each
--disappears when in play, either disappears or is faded when dead?



Variables needed

-Object for overall game

--objects or arrays within for each character
---8 ability score stats (Attack Defense Hit Dodge Physical Technological Magic Holy)...first four for base version.
---2 for hp/max hp (in like third version may add in mp and specials)
---1 for element (might change to 2 later)
---1 for current place - alive, player, computer, dead...might do this as separate variable
---(2 for leveling and exp)
---(multiple or an array for status effects)


Functions
 -change wallpaper/element changes wallpaper (and may give strength/weakness to characters..whether this is random or not depends ondifficulty level - easy always favors you, normal is random, high favors enemy)
 -attack - current player character tries to hit enemy, if it hits, they damage the enemy. minus defense stat.
 -defend - same as attack except for enemy
 -click event for attack to trigger attack then defend.
 --other attacks get similar, but give type of attack to attack function...if attack function does not recieve anything, it would count it as untyped
 -function for selecting character
 -function for selecting enemy
 -trigger events for selecting char/enemy that only work when you have no char/enemy. This can be one event for all characters, that sends that one to the last available spot (char, then enemy)
 -win/lose function?
